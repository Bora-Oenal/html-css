        Let's break down your examples one by one.

        @media (max-width:632px)
        /* This one is saying for a window with a max-width of 632px that you want to apply these styles. 
        At that size you would be talking about anything smaller than a desktop screen in most cases. */

        @media screen and (max-width:632px)
        /* This one is saying for a device with a screen and a window with max-width of 632px apply the style. 
        This is almost identical to the above except you are specifying screen as opposed to the other available 
        media types the most common other one being print.
        screen ist Medientyp, kann z.B. auch print sein*/

        @media only screen and (max-width:632px)
        /* As there is no such media type as "only", the style sheet should be ignored by older browsers. */

    </style>
